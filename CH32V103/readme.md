# MCU Template for CH32V103 Microcontrollers
The CH32V103 is a general purpose microcontroller based on the 32-bit RISC processor RISC-V3A. The CH32V103 provides clock security system, multi-level power management, and general DMA controller. The CH32V103 is also equipped with abundant peripheral resources, such as single USB2.0 host/device interface, multi-channel 12-bit ADC module, multi-channel TouchKey, several timers, and multi-channel IIC/USART/SPI interfaces, etc.

The *template* directory includes a makefile, a PlatformIO.ini file, an illustrative program, a linker script, and fundamental libraries. These elements are intended to serve as a foundation for beginning the development of bare-metal firmware in the C programming language for this particular microcontroller.

Furthermore, inside the *libraries* directory, there are optional libraries available for certain peripherals. If you intend to utilize these libraries, you need to copy them into the *src* folder within the *template* directory.

# Using the Makefile
To make use of the Makefile, it's necessary to install some extra software components to fully set up the toolchain:

## Install GCC toolchain for compiling
```
sudo apt install build-essential libnewlib-dev gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf
```

## Install Python3 and programming tools
```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip install chprog rvprog
```

## Give access permission to the factory built-in bootloader
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="4348", ATTR{idProduct}=="55e0", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch55x.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

## Give access permission to the WCH-LinkE programmer
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8010", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8012", MODE="666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

## Compiling/Uploading
Edit the *makefile* according to the needs of the project. Use one of the following commands inside the *template* folder to compile/upload:

```
make all       compile and build <firmware>.elf/.bin/.hex/.asm
make hex       compile and build <firmware>.hex
make asm       compile and disassemble to <firmware>.asm
make bin       compile and build <firmware>.bin
make flash     compile and upload to MCU
make clean     remove all build files
```

# Using PlatformIO
- Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) and [platform-ch32v](https://github.com/Community-PIO-CH32V/platform-ch32v). Follow [these instructions](https://pio-ch32v.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to do so. Linux/Mac users may also need to install [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv).
- Click on "Open Project" and select the *template* folder with the *platformio.ini* file.
- Edit the *platformio.ini* according to the needs of the project and your programmmer.
- Connect the WCH-LinkE to the target board, then click "Upload".
