# MCU Template for CH32V203 Microcontrollers
The CH32V203 is an industrial-grade microcontroller (MCU) designed for general-purpose use, with low power consumption and enhanced performance. It is based on a 32-bit RISC-V core, supports the RV32IMAC instruction set, and can operate at clock frequencies of up to 144MHz. The MCU's power consumption is highly efficient, reaching as low as 45uA per MHz. Additionally, the CH32V203 integrates a USB interface with two channels, enabling both USB Host and USB Device functionalities. It also provides a CAN interface (2.0B active) with one channel, up to two OPA channels, four UARTs, two IÂ²Cs, a 12-bit ADC, a 10-channel TouchKey, and various other peripheral resources.

The *template* directory includes a makefile, a PlatformIO.ini file, an illustrative program, a linker script, and fundamental libraries. These elements are intended to serve as a foundation for beginning the development of bare-metal firmware in the C programming language for this particular microcontroller.

Furthermore, inside the *libraries* directory, there are optional libraries available for certain peripherals. If you intend to utilize these libraries, you need to copy them into the *src* folder within the *template* directory.

# Using the Makefile
To make use of the Makefile, it's necessary to install some extra software components to fully set up the toolchain:

## Install GCC toolchain for compiling
```
sudo apt install build-essential libnewlib-dev gcc-riscv64-unknown-elf
```

## Install Python3 and programming tools
```
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
pip install chprog rvprog
```

## Give access permission to the factory built-in bootloader
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="4348", ATTR{idProduct}=="55e0", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ch55x.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

## Give access permission to the WCH-LinkE programmer
```
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8010", MODE="666"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="8012", MODE="666"' | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-WCH-LinkE.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

## Compiling/Uploading
Edit the *makefile* according to the needs of the project. Use one of the following commands inside the *template* folder to compile/upload:

```
make all       compile and build <firmware>.elf/.bin/.hex/.asm
make hex       compile and build <firmware>.hex
make asm       compile and disassemble to <firmware>.asm
make bin       compile and build <firmware>.bin
make flash     compile and upload to MCU
make clean     remove all build files
```

# Using PlatformIO
- Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org) and [platform-ch32v](https://github.com/Community-PIO-CH32V/platform-ch32v). Follow [these instructions](https://pio-ch32v.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to do so. Linux/Mac users may also need to install [pyenv](https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv).
- Click on "Open Project" and select the *template* folder with the *platformio.ini* file.
- Edit the *platformio.ini* according to the needs of the project and your programmmer.
- Connect the WCH-LinkE to the target board, then click "Upload".
